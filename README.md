### Hey, I'm Sara! :)
Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm backend developer from Brazil! 🇧🇷 I currently work on [Agenda Edu](https://agendaedu.com/) using Ruby on Rails and React.js!

🍵 Tea addicted, interested in education, games, minimalism, innovation, technology, people and design. *(A lot of things, isn't it?)*

I'm always open for a chat, so feel free to reach out to me! 🖖🏻
